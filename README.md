Welcome to RedCuttle.

This project is the hardware and software for a JTAG/SWD/UART port multiplexer
and switcher.

This hardware allows the control of multiple debuggers and targets to be
connected to one another for development and testing purposes. The original
motivation for this is the Hardware In The Loop testing of the Black Magic
Debug firmware on Black Magic Probe hardware.
